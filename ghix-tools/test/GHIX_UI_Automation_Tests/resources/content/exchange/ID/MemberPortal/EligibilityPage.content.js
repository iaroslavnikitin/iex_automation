In almost all cases, NJ FamilyCare will confirm this initial assessment and you will be enrolled in free or low cost Medicaid coverage. You do not need to take any actions now. NJ FamilyCare will be in contact with you about next steps. However, you have the option to enroll in a health plan through GetCoveredNJ at full cost if you have reason to think you will not be found eligible for Medicaid by NJ FamilyCare. If you are enrolled in Medicaid, you will be disenrolled from any GetCoveredNJ health plan you have chosen. You will not get back any premiums you have paid. Select any individual(s) that you would like to enroll in a full cost GetCoveredNJ health plan.",
