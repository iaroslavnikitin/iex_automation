,"[Documentation]","In this scenario, a parent, her domestic partner, and her child apply for coverage.  This scenario demonstrates the UI can successfully build the household when one of applicants (domestic partner) is not part of the tax return.  The mother has an offer of employer sponsored coverage, but because the offer is unaffordable, she and her son are found QHP eligible with APTC.  Because the domestic partner is not filing a tax return, he is eligible for QHP without subsidy."
