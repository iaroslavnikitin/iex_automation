,"[Documentation]","In this simple scenario, a single consumer applies for financial assistance. He attests to job income and to a recent Medicaid denial. The application should include follow-up questions about his Medicaid denial to determine whether he originally applied during open enrollment as well as the date of the denial. Despite income below the Medicaid limit, the consumer is found QHP, APTC, CSR and SEP eligible due to the Medicaid denial attestation."
