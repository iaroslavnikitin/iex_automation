,"[Documentation]","Summary: Multi-Tax household Scenario:
Domestic partners (John and Mary), living together. They have a son name Chris.
John is going to file taxes and claim Chris as a Tax-dependent;
Mary is going to file her own taxes and claim her daughter Alex from a previous marriage.
John is the primary tax filer on this application.
John and his son Chris will get APTC/CSR based John's Income; Mary and her daughter will be considered as a separate household, and will not qualify for APTC/CSR through this application and hence will only get QHP.Mary and her household will only get QHP, if she wants to be considered for any subsidies then he has to file a separate application."
