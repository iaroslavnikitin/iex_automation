,"[Documentation]","Summary: In this scenario, testers should reaccess the application from Test Case H through a change in circumstance (CiC). In this scenario, Betty is no longer pregnant and the couple is adding their child to their application.  This demonstrates the application is able to support CiCs that result in program eligibility changes.  Because Betty is no longer pregnant, she is now QHP and APTC w/CSR eligible and the child is eligible for Medicaid."
