,"[Documentation]","Summary: Demonstrates functionality and logic related to former foster care applicants.  In this scenario, the older child answers affirmatively to having been at foster care at age 18 or older and that they aged out of the foster care system.  The younger child is applying with a name different than on their SSN card.  The primary applicant and younger  child is found eligible for QHP w/APTC based on income while the older child is determined preliminarily eligible for Medicaid based on former foster care status."
