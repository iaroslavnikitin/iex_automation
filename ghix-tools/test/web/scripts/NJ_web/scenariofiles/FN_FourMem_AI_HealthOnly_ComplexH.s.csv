,"[Documentation]","Demonstrates functionality for a mixed eligibility household with multiple income and deduction types, other health coverage, and a move and loss of MEC SEP.  In a four member household FA application, one member is a non applicant, one is determined eligible for QHP with APTC, one member determined eligible for QHP without subsidy, and the child assessed as eligible for CHIP.  Note the application is eligible for two SEPs (move and loss of MEC); the FFE's logic will grant the loss of MEC SEP."
